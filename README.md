### 1. Overall Project Purpose
This is a financial analysis project that combines social media sentiment (Twitter data) with stock market data to predict stock price movements. The main goal is to understand if social media sentiment can help predict stock price changes.

### 2. Data Processing (`data_processing.py`)

#### A. Data Loading and Initial Setup
```python
TWEET_DATA_PATH = 'archive/tweet.csv'
STOCK_DATA_FOLDER = 'archive/Stocks/'
START_DATE = '2015-01-01'
END_DATE = '2019-12-31'
```
- We're working with two main data sources:
  1. Twitter data containing tweets about stocks
  2. Historical stock market data
- The analysis period is from 2015 to 2019

#### B. Tweet Data Processing
1. **Loading and Cleaning Tweets**
   - Loads tweet data from CSV
   - Handles missing values
   - Converts timestamps to proper datetime format
   - Cleans tweet text by:
     - Converting to lowercase
     - Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags
     - Removing punctuation and numbers
     - Removing extra whitespace

2. **Ticker Extraction**
   - Extracts stock tickers (e.g., $AAPL) from tweets
   - Identifies the top 10 most frequently mentioned companies
   - Filters tweets to only include these top 10 companies

#### C. Stock Data Processing
1. **Loading Stock Data**
   - Loads historical stock data for the top 10 companies
   - Includes price data (Open, High, Low, Close)
   - Includes trading volume

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converts dates to datetime format
   - Filters data to match the analysis period
   - Handles missing values using forward fill
   - Ensures data types are correct

#### D. Data Merging
- Combines tweet and stock data based on date and ticker
- Creates a unified dataset for analysis
- Saves the final merged dataset to a CSV file

### 3. Analysis (`analysis.py`)

#### A. Sentiment Analysis
```python
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
```
- Uses VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to analyze tweet sentiment
- Calculates compound sentiment scores for each tweet
- Aggregates sentiment scores by day and company

#### B. Feature Engineering
1. **Technical Indicators**
   - Calculates daily returns

   - Helps capture historical patterns

#### C. Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Models Used**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost

2. **Evaluation Approach**
   - Uses TimeSeriesSplit for cross-validation
   - Evaluates models using:
     - Accuracy

   - Analyzes feature importance

#### D. Visualization and Results
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Saves detailed classification reports
   - Generates confusion matrices
   - Creates feature importance plots

2. **Price vs. Sentiment Visualization**
   - Creates plots showing stock price vs. sentiment
   - Helps visualize the relationship between sentiment and price movements

### 4. Why This Approach?

1. **Data Integration**
   - Combines structured (stock prices) and unstructured (tweets) data
   - Provides a more comprehensive view of market movements

2. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Uses proper time series cross-validation
   - Respects temporal ordering of data
   - Prevents data leakage

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creates meaningful features from raw data
   - Captures both technical and sentiment aspects
   - Includes lagged features to capture temporal patterns

4. **Model Selection**
   - Uses multiple models for comparison
   - Includes both simple (Logistic Regression) and complex (XGBoost) models
   - Provides robust evaluation metrics

### 5. Key Technical Points to Explain

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Why clean tweets? To remove noise and focus on meaningful content
   - Why handle missing values? To ensure data quality and model reliability
   - Why use datetime conversion? To properly align time series data

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - VADER is specifically designed for social media text
   - Compound score ranges from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive)
   - Daily aggregation helps smooth out noise

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Technical indicators capture market trends
   - Lagged features help predict future movements
   - Sentiment features provide social context

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - TimeSeriesSplit prevents future data leakage
   - Multiple metrics provide comprehensive evaluation
   - Feature importance helps understand model decisions

### 6. Potential Questions and Answers

1. **Why use social media data?**
   - Social media reflects market sentiment
   - Can provide early signals of market movements
   - Complements traditional technical analysis

2. **Why these specific companies?**
   - Top 10 most mentioned companies
   - Ensures sufficient data for analysis
   - Represents major market players

3. **Why this time period?**
   - 2015-2019 provides enough data for analysis
   - Avoids recent market anomalies (COVID-19)
   - Represents a relatively stable market period

4. **Why multiple models?**
   - Different models capture different patterns
   - Provides robustness in predictions
   - Helps identify the best approach

5. **How to interpret the results?**
   - Look at multiple metrics (not just accuracy)
   - Consider feature importance
   - Analyze confusion matrices
   - Compare model performance

This code represents a comprehensive approach to financial market analysis that combines traditional technical analysis with modern sentiment analysis from social media. It follows best practices in data science and provides a robust framework for understanding the relationship between social media sentiment and stock market movements.

I'll help you analyze and interpret each of these plots and the provided results.

1. **AAPL Stock Price vs. Daily Mean Sentiment Plot**
- The blue line represents Apple's stock closing price from 2015 to early 2018
- The red dotted line shows the mean sentiment compound score
- We can observe that:
  - The stock price shows a significant upward trend starting from mid-2016
  - The sentiment score (ranging from -1 to 1) fluctuates but generally stays positive
  - There appears to be some correlation between sentiment spikes and price movements, particularly noticeable in late 2017

2. **Feature Importance Plot (XGBoost - Gain)**
- Shows the top 20 most important features in predicting stock movement
- Features are labeled f1, f2, etc.
- The longer the bar, the more important the feature is for prediction
- The top features (f1, f17, f16) contribute significantly more to the model's decisions
- This suggests that certain lagged variables (likely price, volume, or sentiment indicators) are more predictive than others

3. **Feature Correlation Matrix**
- Shows correlations between different lagged features
- The color scale ranges from dark blue (strong negative correlation) to dark red (strong positive correlation)
- Key observations:
  - Strong positive correlations between consecutive lags of the same feature (visible in diagonal blocks)
  - Daily tweet volume lags show moderate positive correlations with each other
  - RSI lags show strong correlations with each other
  - Most cross-feature correlations are relatively weak (light blue or white)

4. **Confusion Matrices (LR, RF, XGB)**
Let's compare the three models:

Logistic Regression (LR):
- Down (0): 1272 correct predictions, 1208 incorrect
- Up (1): 1377 correct predictions, 1303 incorrect
- Relatively balanced but modest performance

Random Forest (RF):
- Down (0): 967 correct predictions, 1513 incorrect
- Up (1): 1730 correct predictions, 950 incorrect
- Better at predicting upward movements but more biased

XGBoost (XGB):
- Down (0): 1140 correct predictions, 1340 incorrect
- Up (1): 1568 correct predictions, 1112 incorrect
- More balanced than RF but still shows some bias toward predicting upward movements

From the classification reports:
- All three models achieve accuracy around 51-52%
- XGBoost performs slightly better overall with:
  - Accuracy: 52.48%
  - Precision for Up: 54.01%
  - Recall for Up: 58.51%
  - F1-score for Up: 55.97%

The results suggest that while the models are performing better than random chance (50%), the improvement is modest. This is common in stock prediction tasks due to the inherent difficulty and noise in financial markets. The XGBoost model shows slightly better performance, particularly in identifying upward movements, but the difference between models is not dramatic.

The feature importance and correlation analysis suggest that there are some meaningful patterns in the data, but the relatively low predictive power indicates that stock price movements remain challenging to predict with high accuracy using these features alone.
